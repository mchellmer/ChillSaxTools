The DeeJay sets the saxophone sound engine and adjusts various levels

# What can the DeeJay do?
**!engine (engine name)** e.g. !engine lofi - set the engine, this is the overall character of the sound
**!dial1 (0-11)** e.g. !dial1 11 - set the engine specific dial1 value
**!dial2 (0-11)** e.g. !dial2 11 - set the engine specific dial2 value
**!time (0-11)** e.g. !time 11 - set duration the engine affects the raw sound
**!delay (0-11)** e.g. !delay 11 - set the delay between raw sound and effect kicking in
**!(engine name)** e.g. !lofi - display description of engine and its dials in info panel
**!(dial effect)** e.g. !bass - display description of dial effect at 0 -> 11 values in info panel

# What engines are there and what do they do?
**room** - like playing sax in a cosy room (dial1: bass, dial2: moddepth)
**hall** - like playing sax in a large hall (dial1: bass, dial2: size)
**dome** - like playing sax in a huge reverberation chamber (dial1: bass, dial2: moddepth)
**spring** - apply classic echo effects with spring reverb (dial1: bass, dial2: length)
**plate** - apply penetrating reverberations of sound between sheets of metal (dial1: bass, dial2: distortion)
**lofi** - oversaturate and fuzz up the sound (dial1: distortion, dial2: moddepth)
**modverb** - apply string like tremolo effects (dial1: depth, dial2: tremolo)
**shimmer** - generate shimmering reflections of sounds at shifted pitches (dial1: crossfade, dial2: regen)
**echoverb** - combine delay and rever into one layer for ultimate ambience (dial1: feedback, dial2: crossfade)
**swell** - swell the sound into long ambient clouds (dial1: envelopegain, dial2: duration)
**offspring** - angel and scifi, this layer is totally unpredictable (dial1: bass, dial2: moddepth)
**reverse** - create chilling shadows of produced sounds (dial1: diffusion, dial2: moddepth)

# Example DeeJay interaction in chat
**the8bitsaxbot**: !engine lofi - sound engine changes to lofi
**the8bitsaxbot**: !delay 11 - change delay to max to add huge echo to sound
**the8bitsaxbot**: !time 2 - set low value for time so echo is short and abrupt
**the8bitsaxbot**: !dial1 11 - lofi dial1 is distortion, set to max for huge grittiness
**the8bitsaxbot**: !dial2 5 - lofi dial2 is moddepth, set to mid-range for moderate oscillations
**the8bitsaxbot**: !engine room - lofi was too much for them, let's go to a cosy room sound
