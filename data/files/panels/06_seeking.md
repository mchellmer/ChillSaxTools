# 1972 needs your help!
## Are you a musician who can offer advice?
**1972 is not a trained musician**, they are very much winging all of this with less than 5 years of self-training. If you can offer any advice Seven would be extremely grateful.

## Are you an artist?
Do you make art matching the aesthetic of this stream? **1972 is looking for an artist** to make bespoke versions of everything you see. Panels, backgrounds, obs overlays, custom animations, everything!
