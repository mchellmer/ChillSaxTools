# 1972 Welcomes You!
Your intergalactic host today is named ‘1972’ and he welcomes you to The8BitSaxLounge! **Call me ‘Seven’ (‘Se-vyen’), ‘Sev’ or ‘7’ for short**.

Cruising the galaxy on a comet, 1972 has made many attempts to land, the first being in Earth year 1972 when they crashed into an arcade hidden away in the forests of California.

He learned his first bits, boops, and honks of human language through retro arcades and jazz records. Taking up the saxophone, **Sev then incorporated drum and synth loops inspired by 8-bit games to create a unique sound** that will transport you to another world of chill.

This channel aims to create **a chill space for viewers to lounge and relax** while enjoying Sev's captivating sound. As he continues exploring human language, he needs your help to find his sound.

If you should join Sev on this journey **you can shape his sound through a command console** you link to from the convenience of your own home.
