# What is 1972 jamming with?
**Synth** - BassStation2 mono synth
**Drums** - Tr8s drum machine
**Sax** - Yanagisawa AWO10 alto saxophone
**Effects Loop** - xlr mic -> VocoLoco preamp -> Ventris DualReverb -> DittoX2 Looper -> VocoLoco preamp -> Audio Jack

# What are 1972's loops?
**Bass lines** - parts stripped from classics (mainly ff6 for now), sticking to NES style triangle and square waves 
**Drum parts** - something improvised to match the bass, all sounds are samples from NES 2a03 APU

# Where does all the magic happen?
**Sound** - The Ventris DualReverb pedal has a huge array of sound engines and parameters to tweak it
**Code** - Custom code sends midi signals to the effects loop based on chat commands
**Stream magic** - twitch chat -> streamer.bot -> midi signals to effects loop + obs asset updates
